# copy_paste_aug_detectron2


Copy-paste aug implementation was taken from this awesome [repository](https://github.com/conradry/copy-paste-aug). Original paper is [Simple Copy-Paste is a Strong Data Augmentation Method for Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07177v1)

Copy-paste augmentation in detectron2 pipeline is presented in  ```detectron2_copypaste.ipynb```. You can also add any augmentation from [albumentations](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations).

I will add more information in ```Readme``` and my code soon.
